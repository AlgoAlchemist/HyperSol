### Participants

Users of Synthetify protocol could be divided into three roles:
- Staker
- Trader
- Liquidator

### Staker

A Staker is responsible for initial creation of debt and synthetic assets. Stakers lock their SNY tokens inside smart contract and use it to create synthetic USD (xUSD) that later can be exchanged for other types of synthetic assets. In reward for creating liquidity for Traders and acting as opposite side of trades performed on Synthetify exchange they receive pro rata fees generated by exchange and inflation rewards. To unlock SNY tokens Stakers need to burn synthetic tokens equal to value of their debt.

### Trader

A Trader performs exchange of assets using Synthetify exchange. To engage in trading activity a trader needs firstly buy synthetic assets from other markets like centralized exchanges or mint it himself by acting as Staker.

### Liquidator
