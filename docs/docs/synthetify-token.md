### Overview
Synthetify exchange allows users to engage in trading activity without need of direct counterparty. Stakers of protocol act as counterparty for all trades and in exchange for that they receive pro rata exchange fee and inflation rewards.

Each trade has a static fee currently 0.3% and no matter a size of the trade it prices of exchange stays the same. This feature often is calls "Infinite Liquidity" but is limited by the amount of debt created by Stakers. Trading on Synthetify exchange does not require ownership of its native token SNY or staking it, the only thing necessary is ownership any of synthetic assets.

### Listing new assets

Adding new assets to Synthetify exchange require existence of reliable price oracle for this asset. Currently, Synthetify team controls what assets are listed on exchange but in the future this task will be moved to governance instance.
