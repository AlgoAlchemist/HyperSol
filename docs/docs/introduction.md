### Synthetify !!!

**Synthetify** is decentralized synthetic assets protocol build on [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain. The protocol allows for creation and exchange of synthetic assets that closely track the price of specific assets. Synthetic tokens are based on [SPL-Token](https://spl.solana.com/token) standard that gives them ability to be easily integrated with other DeFi applications like AMM.

Synthetify leverages Solana ecosystem to enable fast, cheap and intuitive trading experience for users of platform while keeping it fully decentralized thanks to an infrastructure build on top of number of smart contracts and blockchain oracles.

The Synthetify Token (SNY) gives the ability to participate in protocol by staking them in smart contract. Stakers receive pro rata share of fees generated by exchange and additional inflation rewards. SNY acts as collateral token for all synthetic assets created on the platform and each token will have voting power on future governance proposals.
